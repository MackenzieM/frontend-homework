#Homework for frontend candidate

Dear candidate,
you will work on building an editor/editors for our domain model objects. Don't worry about making it perfect, 
but approach it as you would for a production system. This is an opportunity to do your best work without time 
constraints and with your favorite tools at your disposal. In order to help you getting started, we
are providing some of the code. We are looking for component design, your ability to navigate the Angular 
stack, edge cases, etc.  Bonus points if you can add some charts and graphs to the dashboard page. 
Instructions about getting the project running are bellow.

Have fun and good luck!

## Angular2DevelopmentCLI

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.11-webpack.8.

You will need to install node > 7.5

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). 
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
